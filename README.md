# ModPacker-CSharp

This is a reimplementation of the Java based ModPacker application for the game NeverWinter Nights. 

It allows you to read in an NWN module file into C# classes, manipulate the data and then write out the updated mod file.

You can do whatever you want with the data - put it into a database, write to JSON/XML, etc.

This package is designed for programmers in mind and does not offer the same command line tools the original provided. (But you can easily do all of that in C#)
